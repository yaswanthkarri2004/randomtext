# Random Text Generator

This is a JavaScript program that generates random text in different formats: word, sentence, and bullet points. It uses the `Math.random()` function to randomly select words and construct the desired text.

## Usage

To use the random text generator, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Select the type of text you want to generate: word, sentence, or bullet points.

4. Click the "Generate" button to generate the random text.

5. The generated text will be displayed on the page.

## Examples

### Word Generator

To generate a random word, click on the "Word" button. The program will select a random word from a predefined list of meaningful words and display it on the page.

### Sentence Generator

To generate a random sentence, click on the "Sentence" button. The program will construct a sentence by randomly selecting words from the predefined list and arranging them in a grammatically correct order. The sentence will be displayed on the page.

### Bullet Points Generator

To generate a list of bullet points, click on the "Bullet Points" button. The program will randomly select words from the predefined list and create a list of bullet points. The number of bullet points can be customized by adjusting the `numPoints` variable in the JavaScript code.

## Customization

You can customize the random text generator by modifying the predefined list of words or adjusting the `numPoints` variable for the bullet points generator. Open the `script.js` file and make the necessary changes.
